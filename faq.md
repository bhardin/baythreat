    <h3>What's different about BayThreat?</h3>
    <p>BayThreat is the first regional con that caters to those of us in the South Bay! This crazy scheme was hatched at a #SiliSec meeting, and we're looking forward to a con with one less cross-country flight :) </p>
    <p>BayThreat is bringing the caliber of speakers usually seen only at the major cons to the Bay Area because many of these speakers are local and interested in more elite and fun events in the Bay scene!</p>
