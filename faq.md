## What's different about BayThreat?

BayThreat is the first regional con that caters to those of us in the South Bay! This crazy scheme was hatched at a #SiliSec meeting, and we're looking forward to a con with one less cross-country flight :)

BayThreat is bringing the caliber of speakers usually seen only at the major cons to the Bay Area because many of these speakers are local and interested in more elite and fun events in the Bay scene!

## What are the different tickets?

Tickets are non-refundable after December 1, 2012.

There are 3 different ticket options:

General Admission: This ticket is gets you entrance into all 3 days of the BayThreat Conference at the Hacker Dojo for 2011. We provide coffee, lunch, snacks, and beverages. You also receive a free BayThreat 2011 t-shirt and an electronic badge.

Student Admission: All of the above, at a discount for current students that can provide a Student ID that is in good standing. Faculty ID is also acceptable.

## How can I volunteer at BayThreat?
