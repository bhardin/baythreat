    <p> The Call for Papers for the second annual BayThreat security conference is now closed.</p>
    <p> BayThreat is a 3 day event at the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, CA, December 9th, 10th, and 11th. The theme for BayThreat is as simple as black &amp; white: "Building &amp; Breaking Security." There will be two tracks, each tackling opposite sides of the security fence.</p>
    <p>Previous conference topics have included:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li> Mobile Security</li> 
      <li> Internet Infrastructure<br> 
      </li> 
      <li> Hardware<br> 
      </li> 
      <li> Incident Response<br> 
      </li> 
      <li> Lockpicking<br> 
      </li> 
      <li> Botnets and Malware<br> 
      </li> 
      <li> Game Hacking <br> 
      </li> 
    </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
        
        Do you have a topic that will fit in with our theme of "Building &amp; Breaking Security?" We would love to hear it! We're accepting abstracts now. Talks will be chosen based on the normal qualities... coolness, timeliness, preparedness. Most importantly, however, all of the talks must be ACTIONABLE. Speakers must strive to educate the audience, and then provide take-home advice that leads to the participants actually DOING something.<p></p>
    <p>As we expect most of the presenters will be local, travel will not be compensated, but we are happy to make recommendations. If you haven't been to stunning Mountain View before, you're in for a real treat. </p>
    <p>We look forward to reading what you're working on!</p>
