## A Hacker Con in the Bay Area

BayThreat 2011 is the 2nd annual information security conference in the South Bay at The Hacker Dojo, December 9th, 10th & 11th. What you've heard from last year is just the beginning. We're adding an extra day of workshops, hacking, and hanging out to make this year the best yet.

The theme for BayThreat is as simple as black & white: "Building & Breaking Security." Two tracks, each tackling opposite sides of the security fence. As Security Professionals, it is up to us to take that dichotomy and mold it into the shades of gray we use to protect our environment.

## Shades of the Gray Area

We've invited speakers from all over the Bay Area and beyond to a 3 day conference at the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, CA. The Dojo is a familiar place for the security community, as it hosts the #DC650 meetings every month.

We're excited to host speakers with security expertise from both sides of the fence. Check out the schedule!

Follow us at @BayThreat on Twitter for all the latest announcements about BayThreat, or look for us on Facebook and LinkedIn where you can join our groups.

Please consider being VOLUNTEER! We give tickets for those that help out!
