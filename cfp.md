The Call for Papers for the 3rd BayThreat security conference is open!

BayThreat is a 2 day event in Sunnyvale, CA, December 7th & 8th. The theme for BayThreat is a new spin on the dichotomy of attacking and defending in information security. We're calling out all of the attackers and defenders that are on the front lines of the battle. We'll analyse the latest attack strategies, both real and red team, and then switch sides to hear from the first responders living on the wrong side of the DMZ.

This year we are seeking security first responders willing to share some of their war stories. What worked? What didn't? What have you had to put up with / been put through? Is it getting any better? Is it getting any worse? Maybe you just have a great story - we'd like to hear about it and see if it fits!

Previous conference topics have included:

* Mobile Security
* Internet Infrastructure
* Hardware
* Incident Response
* Lockpicking
* Botnets and Malware
* Game Hacking
* Social Engineering
* Attacks, Persistance, Exfiltration

Do you have a war story from the front lines? We would love to hear it! We're accepting abstracts now. Talks will be chosen based on the normal qualities... coolness, timeliness, preparedness. Most importantly, however, all of the talks must be ACTIONABLE. Speakers must strive to educate the audience, and then provide take-home advice that leads to the participants actually DOING something.
As we expect most of the presenters will be local, travel will not be compensated, but we are happy to make recommendations. Sunnyvale has close and affordable lodging, and is steps from the Caltrain Station.

We look forward to reading about what you've been working on!

-Marisa Fagan (Speaker Coordinator)
